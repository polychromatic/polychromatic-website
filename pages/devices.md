Polychromatic by itself is just a frontend, and doesn't contain driver code to
directly control RGB hardware.

This project only supports [OpenRazer] at the moment.
In future, we'd like to add support for other brands using [phue](https://github.com/polychromatic/polychromatic/issues/296),
[OpenRGB](https://github.com/polychromatic/polychromatic/issues/340) and
[libratbag](https://github.com/polychromatic/polychromatic/issues/339).
This is a fairly new objective. [Read more about the history of this project.](https://docs.polychromatic.app/history/)
